***************************
ROCm is an open-source software platform optimized to extract HPC and AI workload performance from AMD Instinct GPUs and AMD Radeon GPUs while maintaining compatibility with industry software frameworks. For more information, see What is ROCm?

ROCm supports multiple programming languages and programming interfaces such as HIP (Heterogeneous-Compute Interface for Portability), OpenCL, and OpenMP, as explained in the Programming guide.

If you’re using AMD Radeon GPUs or Ryzen APUs in a workstation setting with a display connected, review ROCm on Radeon and Ryzen documentation.

ROCm documentation is organized into the following categories:
*******************
What is ROCm?

Applies to Linux and Windows
ROCm is a software stack, composed primarily of open-source software, that provides the tools for programming AMD Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), from low-level kernels to high-level end-user applications.

************************************
Specifically, ROCm provides the tools for HIP (Heterogeneous-computing Interface for Portability), OpenCL and OpenMP. These include compilers, libraries for high-level functions, debuggers, profilers and runtimes.
